Multithreading: A Process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
            --> Used to achieve multi-tasking

Thread: Lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.

Creating Thread in Java:
    1. Using the Runnable interface
    2. Using the Thread class

Using the Runnable interface is better approach as the custom thread class can also extend some other class in this case.

Lifecycle of a thread: New --> Runnable --> Running --> Terminated
                                    ||
                                Blocked(Non - Runnable) {In case of sleep, wait etc}

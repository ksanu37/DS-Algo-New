Java is one of the most programming languages out there. Java has many applications and a huge chunks of mobile/web applications
that you use on a day to day basis are written in Java.
For instance, all the android applications that you see today use Java in one way or the other.


Java is an Object Oriented Programming languages, which levarages all the advantages of the OOPS concepts.
Example: Inheritence, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation


Java is platform independent: Java programs are first converted into bytecodes, using a compiler. Then the bytecode runs on
JVM (Java Virtual Machine), irrespective of the underlying architecture. Hence, Java code are easily reusable.


Java Syntax is pretty similar to that of C++. But Java does not provide low level programming functionalities like pointers.


Java is kind of in between C++ and Python. Java programs run faster than Python programs but slower than C++ Programs.
While Java and C++ do static type checking, Python does dynamic type checking




Static Type Checking: Variables must be declared before use.
Dynamic: Need not.

Dynamic Type Checking: reduces stress of declaring and maintaining types of variables at each point in the application,
but it can lead to certain issue at run time.

Example:
number = 10;
numbr = number * 10;   // Typo in number leads to declaration of another variable numbr
